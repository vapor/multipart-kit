/// An ordered collection of key-value pairs.
///
/// Like the standard `Dictionary`, ordered dictionaries use a hash table to
/// ensure that no two entries have the same keys, and to efficiently look up
/// values corresponding to specific keys. However, like an `Array` (and
/// unlike `Dictionary`), ordered dictionaries maintain their elements in a
/// particular user-specified order, and they support efficient random-access
/// traversal of their entries.
///
/// `OrderedDictionary` is a useful alternative to `Dictionary` when the order
/// of elements is important, or when you need to be able to efficiently access
/// elements at various positions within the collection.
///
/// You can create an ordered dictionary with any key type that conforms to the
/// `Hashable` protocol.
///
///     let responses: OrderedDictionary = [
///       200: "OK",
///       403: "Access forbidden",
///       404: "File not found",
///       500: "Internal server error",
///     ]
///
/// ### Equality of Ordered Dictionaries
///
/// Two ordered dictionaries are considered equal if they contain the same
/// elements, and *in the same order*. This matches the concept of equality of
/// an `Array`, and it is different from the unordered `Dictionary`.
///
///     let a: OrderedDictionary = [1: "one", 2: "two"]
///     let b: OrderedDictionary = [2: "two", 1: "one"]
///     a == b // false
///     b.swapAt(0, 1) // `b` now has value [1: "one", 2: "two"]
///     a == b // true
///
/// (`OrderedDictionary` only conforms to `Equatable` when its `Value` is
/// equatable.)
///
/// ### Dictionary Operations
///
/// `OrderedDictionary` provides many of the same operations as `Dictionary`.
///
/// For example, you can look up and add/remove values using the familiar
/// key-based subscript, returning an optional value:
///
///     var dictionary: OrderedDictionary<String, Int> = [:]
///     dictionary["one"] = 1
///     dictionary["two"] = 2
///     dictionary["three"] // nil
///     // dictionary is now ["one": 1, "two": 2]
///
/// If a new entry is added using the subscript setter, it gets appended to the
/// end of the dictionary. (So that by default, the dictionary contains its
/// elements in the order they were originally inserted.)
///
/// `OrderedDictionary` also implements the variant of this subscript that takes
/// a default value. Like with `Dictionary`, this is useful when you want to
/// perform in-place mutations on values:
///
///     let text = "short string"
///     var counts: OrderedDictionary<Character, Int> = [:]
///     for character in text {
///       counts[character, default: 0] += 1
///     }
///     // counts is ["s": 2, "h": 1, "o": 1,
///     //            "r": 2, "t": 2, " ": 1,
///     //            "i": 1, "n": 1, "g": 1]
///
/// If the `Value` type implements reference semantics, or when you need to
/// perform a series of individual mutations on the values, the closure-based
/// `modifyValue(forKey:default:_:)` method provides an easier-to-use
/// alternative to the defaulted key-based subscript.
///
///     let text = "short string"
///     var counts: OrderedDictionary<Character, Int> = [:]
///     for character in text {
///       counts.modifyValue(forKey: character, default: 0) { value in
///         value += 1
///       }
///     }
///     // Same result as before
///
/// (This isn't currently available on the regular `Dictionary`.)
///
/// The `Dictionary` type's original `updateValue(_:forKey:)` method is also
/// available, and so is `index(forKey:)`, grouping/uniquing initializers
/// (`init(uniqueKeysWithValues:)`, `init(_:uniquingKeysWith:)`,
/// `init(grouping:by:)`), methods for merging one dictionary with another
/// (`merge`, `merging`), filtering dictionary entries (`filter(_:)`),
/// transforming values (`mapValues(_:)`), and a combination of these two
/// (`compactMapValues(_:)`).
///
/// ### Sequence and Collection Operations
///
/// Ordered dictionaries use integer indices representing offsets from the
/// beginning of the collection. However, to avoid ambiguity between key-based
/// and indexing subscripts, `OrderedDictionary` doesn't directly conform to
/// `Collection`. Instead, it only conforms to `Sequence`, and provides a
/// random-access collection view over its key-value pairs:
///
///     responses[0] // `nil` (key-based subscript)
///     responses.elements[0] // `(200, "OK")` (index-based subscript)
///
/// Because ordered dictionaries need to maintain unique keys, neither
/// `OrderedDictionary` nor its `elements` view can conform to the full
/// `MutableCollection` or `RangeReplaceableCollection` protocols. However, they
/// are able to partially implement requirements: they support mutations
/// that merely change the order of elements, or just remove a subset of
/// existing members:
///
///     // Permutation operations from MutableCollection:
///     func swapAt(_ i: Int, _ j: Int)
///     func partition(by predicate: (Element) throws -> Bool) -> rethrows Int
///     func sort() where Element: Comparable
///     func sort(by predicate: (Element, Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows
///     func shuffle()
///     func shuffle<T: RandomNumberGenerator>(using generator: inout T)
///
///     // Removal operations from RangeReplaceableCollection:
///     func removeAll(keepingCapacity: Bool = false)
///     func remove(at index: Int) -> Element
///     func removeSubrange(_ bounds: Range<Int>)
///     func removeLast() -> Element
///     func removeLast(_ n: Int)
///     func removeFirst() -> Element
///     func removeFirst(_ n: Int)
///     func removeAll(where shouldBeRemoved: (Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows
///
/// `OrderedDictionary` also implements `reserveCapacity(_)` from
/// `RangeReplaceableCollection`, to allow for efficient insertion of a known
/// number of elements. (However, unlike `Array` and `Dictionary`,
/// `OrderedDictionary` does not provide a `capacity` property.)
///
/// ### Keys and Values Views
///
/// Like the standard `Dictionary`, `OrderedDictionary` provides `keys` and
/// `values` properties that provide lightweight views into the corresponding
/// parts of the dictionary.
///
/// The `keys` collection is of type `OrderedSet<Key>`, containing all the keys
/// in the original dictionary.
///
///     let d: OrderedDictionary = [2: "two", 1: "one", 0: "zero"]
///     d.keys // [2, 1, 0] as OrderedSet<Int>
///
/// The `keys` property is read-only, so you cannot mutate the dictionary
/// through it. However, it returns an ordinary ordered set value, which can be
/// copied out and then mutated if desired. (Such mutations won't affect the
/// original dictionary value.)
///
/// The `values` collection is a mutable random-access collection of the values
/// in the dictionary:
///
///     d.values // "two", "one", "zero"
///     d.values[2] = "nada"
///     // `d` is now [2: "two", 1: "one", 0: "nada"]
///     d.values.sort()
///     // `d` is now [2: "nada", 1: "one", 0: "two"]
///
/// Both views store their contents in regular `Array` values, accessible
/// through their `elements` property.
///
/// ## Performance
///
/// Like the standard `Dictionary` type, the performance of hashing operations
/// in `OrderedDictionary` is highly sensitive to the quality of hashing
/// implemented by the `Key` type. Failing to correctly implement hashing can
/// easily lead to unacceptable performance, with the severity of the effect
/// increasing with the size of the hash table.
///
/// In particular, if a certain set of keys all produce the same hash value,
/// then hash table lookups regress to searching an element in an unsorted
/// array, i.e., a linear operation. To ensure hashed collection types exhibit
/// their target performance, it is important to ensure that such collisions
/// cannot be induced merely by adding a particular list of keys to the
/// dictionary.
///
/// The easiest way to achieve this is to make sure `Key` implements hashing
/// following `Hashable`'s documented best practices. The conformance must
/// implement the `hash(into:)` requirement, and every bit of information that
/// is compared in `==` needs to be combined into the supplied `Hasher` value.
/// When used correctly, `Hasher` produces high-quality, randomly seeded hash
/// values that prevent repeatable hash collisions.
///
/// When `Key` correctly conforms to `Hashable`, key-based lookups in an ordered
/// dictionary is expected to take O(1) equality checks on average. Hash
/// collisions can still occur organically, so the worst-case lookup performance
/// is technically still O(*n*) (where *n* is the size of the dictionary);
/// however, long lookup chains are unlikely to occur in practice.
///
/// ## Implementation Details
///
/// An ordered dictionary consists of an ordered set of keys, alongside a
/// regular `Array` value that contains their associated values.
